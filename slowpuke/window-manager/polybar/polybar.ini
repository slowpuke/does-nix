;; using the player-mpris or i could try player-mpris-tail but that one is in python
;; they should work with Tauon hopefully
;; ANOTHER IDEA with playerctl -p tauon i can get all the information, this way i could restrict
;; the information displayed to tauon
;; for the music player you can also use a font-awesome glyph, look at the dualshock script to see how to use it (its easy af...)
;; ANOTHER option is mpd, its an internal module, you can try it but if i had to guess it will display information for all sources
;; if i make the module the information will be only displayed with tauon, still an option to consider though
